    "### Defining A Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `def` keyword is used in defining functions. The `def` keyword is followed by the function name, parenthesis that can either be left empty or containining an argument identifier variable and then a colon `:`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The colon signifies that any other code after it is part of the function's body as long as they're under a defined indentation level. The indentation can either be two spaces, or four spaces ( tab key ) and must be uniform. i.e,\n",

Python promotes the writing of clean, readable code and as such, sub-codes ( code working under the instruction of another such as loops - Explain better in person ) are indented to differentiate them from global variables or main variables in a program. **This explanation is quite hard - I'll have to explain better in person.**\n",
